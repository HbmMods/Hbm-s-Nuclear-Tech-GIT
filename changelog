## Changed
* Material autogen now creates redstone in ingot form, allowing smaller than block quantities to be cast
* Removed the ancient ZPE blocks
* Drone hitboxes are now way smaller, which should cause them to get stuck when flying less
* The new FENSU now keeps its charge and installed muffler when broken
* Battery sockets are now compatible with comparator output
* Battery sockets now have a tooltip when a battery pack is installed
* Sef-charging batteries have been reworked
  * They are now a new item with metadata (legacy ones still work)
  * The base form is an empty selfcharger which is filled with two billets of material, i.e. no more upgrade recipes
  * There are a few new variants like cobalt-60 and gold-198
  * New selfchargers have a model when plugged into a battery socket
  * Selfchargers are a fair bit weaker than their old counterparts, but substantially cheaper too
* Old batteries now have the "LEGACY" tag
* Pneumatic pipe networks with multiple outputs, especially filtered ones, should now have much better throughput due to not constantly failing to send items in round robin mode
* The [N] calculator window now shows a history of previous operations
* Simplified the cyclotron recipe

## Fixed
* Fixed the FEnSU, cyclotron and reliant robin missile being uncraftable due to stacksize limitations
  * The system for detecting impossible recipe has been improved, instead of a fixed 64 item limit, it now uses the actual limit of the item (or 64 for ore dictionary inputs)
* Fixed yet another issue regarding addon fluids breaking on recipe reload
* Fixed YET ANOTHER issue regarding crates, AGAIN
* Fixed a rare issue where the fusion reactor could have negative fuel
* Fixed battery socket priority tooltip offset
* Fixed enchantability on many armor sets being incorrect
  * Most power armors are intended to not be enchantable at all
* Fixed crash caused by the balefire bomb
* Fixed JSON gun reload animations becoming faster and faster with the trenchmaster set
* Fixed heat transfer rate labels on the boilers and coker unit being off by a magnitude of 10
* Fixed crucible not having a heat transfer rate tooltip
* Fixed certain heliostat mirror rotations not showing the mirror
* Fixed chopper recipe creating eight choppers instead of one
