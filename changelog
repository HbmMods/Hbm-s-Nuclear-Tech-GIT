## Gun rework
* Place holder place holder place hooooooooooldeeeeeeeer

## Added
* `/ntmclient`
  * Allows some client-only config options to be edited while ingame
  * Config is stored in `hbmClient.json` in the `hbmConfig` folder
  * Configs can be edited ingame via `/ntmclient set <name> <value>` or in the file and then `/ntmclient reload`
  * Available configs include geiger counter HUD position, info system position and orientation, custom main menu splash texts, ore dict display and custom nuke item info
  * Check the config file or `/ntmclient list` for a full list of values, the name should make them self-explanatory!

## Changed
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* The fine soot recipe in the pyrolysis oven now only needs 4 tar
* Overdrive upgrades now use hard plastic/fullerite instead of lithium crystals
* Machines now only send their sync packets once a second instead of once per tick if the values haven't changed, reducing network traffic by a considerable amount
* Tom's explosion no longer causes any block updates on the millions of blocks it deletes which hopefully fixes a majority of the lag caused by the crater
* Overdrive upgrades now increase power usage in pyrolysis ovens (equivalent to 2 speed upgrades per level)
* Due to the increased maximum demand with overdrives + speed upgrades, the energy buffer for the pyrolysis oven has been increased tenfold
* Updated basalt textures
* Scaffold blocks can now be placed horizontally
* Updated the shredder's textures
* The strand caster will now cast its remaining buffer after 10 seconds of inactivity, even if the buffer is not full enough for a batch of 9
* The soldering station now has a toggle for the "refuse to do recipes with no fluid if fluid is present" behavior
* Recipes using the ore dictionary "oreThorium232" are now also generated for "oreThorium"
* Conveyor grabbers can now output onto belts directly
  * I could have just made grabbers delete the input and spawn an identical item on the output but simply changing the position makes it look like the item is sucked in and it looks hilarious
* Cable connections (connectors, pylons, substations) now render about 10x faster and no longer have weird inaccuracies where the segments meet
* Cables can be made even faster by setting `RENDER_CABLE_HANG` in the config to `false`
  * This causes cable connections to render taut, eliminating the need for multiple segments per pylon side

## Fixed
* The conveyor grabber should no longer skip over items when used in long lines
* Fixed a potential crash regarding crucibles
* Fixed compatibility with EndlessIDs, biome changes should no longer crash the game
* Fixed GL state leak caused by fluid tanks, causing some tile entities to be rendered without face culling
* Fixed a bug where using too many PWR heatsinks would cause an overflow, making the heat capacity negative
* Fixed landmines generating into the floor on superflat worlds
* All NTM type explosions are no longer affected by difficulty setting, preventing them from dealing damage in peaceful mode
  * There are a few instances of vanilla explosions still being used, those will be phased out in the future
* Fixed tutorial presentations triggering when hitting F1 not just in the inventory but also when looking at the block in question
* Fixed a bug regarding shift clicking in the breeding reactor
