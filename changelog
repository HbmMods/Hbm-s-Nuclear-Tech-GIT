## Added
* Muffler
  * An upgrade-like item that replaces the old muffler block
  * Creates 16 when crafted, however it is not returned when the muffled machine is broken
  * Should work with pretty much all machines that use looped sounds, as well as a few other noisy ones (compressors, diesel generators, presses)
  * Simply right-click to install, doesn't need to be inserted into an upgrade slot, in fact it works on a few machines that have no GUI at all

## Fixed
* Fixed basalt ores dropping their items with invalid metadata
* Fixed creative infinite fluid tanks not being able to fill fluid gauges at >0PU
