## Added
* More custom machine parts
  * Custom machines now have a neutron acceptor which allows them to use flux from the breeding reactor in recipes
  * There is now a heat acceptor which can accept heat from things like fireboxes or electric heaters
  * Also added a config option to create pollution

## Changed
* Deco bocks now drop all of the time, but they drop themselves instead of ingots
  * To get the ingots, deco blocks now have to be deconstructed in the anvil, yielding an ingot 25% of the time
  * If I see one more person complaining about the chances I'm reducing it down to 10%
* Catalytic reformers now have a tooltip informing about the need for a catalytic converter
* Several guns now have reload animations including most .357 revolvers and Samuel
* Updated stealth missile texture
* Some of the larger oil machines now render using display lists which should make them somewhat more performant
* Glyphid diggers can no longer yeet multiblocks or blocks with tile entity
* Parasite-infested glyphids now explode into gore when the parasites pop out
* Missiles now have a top acceleration twice as much as the previous acceleration, but instead of being static, the acceleration goes up from 0 to max within 3 seconds
  * This makes missiles reach top speed faster while also making the launches themselves slower and more pleasant
* Strange stone can no longer be destroyed via AoE, making it easier to find without accidentally mining it
* Launch pads now spawn launch smoke just like custom missile compact launchers

## Fixed
* Fixed dupe caused by shift-clicking ashes out of the bricked furnace
* Fixed missiles jerkingly rotating when launching, they should now smoothly transition from being part of the launch pad to being an entity
* Fixed missile control and launch smoke shifting around when the player is moving
* Fixed fast-moving missiles spawning too few particles, causing holes in the contrail
