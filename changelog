## Added
* Machines now emit soot. Soot collects in units of 4x4 chunks, and spreads into neighboring regions. High levels of soot cause visible smog.
  * The system has yet to be balanced, it's possible that only a few machines cause way too much soot or barely any
* Gas artillery shells
  * Chlorine
  * Phosgene
  * Mustard gas
* Euphemium capacitor
  * Used for schrabidium transmutation, has infinite durability
* Capacitor blocks
  * Like batteries without GUIs that are constantly in input/output mode
  * Input is on the top of the capacitor block, for output the capacitor has to be placed onto a capaictor bus
  * Capacitor buses have one side for the output, multiple buses can be chained up given they are placed in a straight line
  * Incentivizes splitting the power grid, looping the output back into the input will yield the same weirdness as combining multiple IO energy storage blocks
* Desh bullet stamps
  * Like regular bullets stamps but with infinite durability

## Changed
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* Mist now spawns cloud particles with the correct color instead of standard white
* HE artillery shells and rockets now turn blocks into slag
* The old static bunker structure has been removed and replaced with dynamically generated ones, using the same style of generation as vanilla strongholds.
* Changed the processing for chlorocalcite, instead of using a combination furnace it now requires a six step cleaning and electrolysis process

## Fixed
* Fixed the TOXIC trait not respecting protection when applying potion effects
* Fixed some armor recipes only accepting polymer and not bakelite
* Fixed turbofans not sucking in players
* Fixed NTM skybox not applying to superflat worlds
* Fixed breeding slot in the fusion reactor never resettingthe progress after completing an operation
* Fixed potential issue where tanks would send fluids to invalidated tile entities, voiding themselves almost instantly
* Fixed cadmium and technetium steel blocks not having ore dict names
* Fixed potential crash regarding certain potion code running clientside
