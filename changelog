## Added
* Butter
    * Can be used to make ice cream or a new shotgun shell

* Dairy Reforming Tank, machine that does things to milk

* Three new types of milk, nade from the afterformentioned machine

* Potion effect, slippery makes you slide around

* strawberry ice cream, yummy.

## Changed
* another new version from bob has been loaded in. yeah...

## Fixed
* i have most likley forgotten.
* Nitra
  * Dropped by the painsaw ability when killing a mob
  * Can be used to quickly craft standard ammo types in the 2x2 crafting grid
  * Can also refill empty syringes, making stimpaks
* Latex
  * Can be made from dandelions or from pressing jungle wood
  * Replaces insulator in many recipes where electrical insulation that is potentially made from brick doesn't make sense, like rubber gas masks, jackets, tools and so on
  * Latex is interchangable with rubber in all recipes where it's used, but not the other way round
  * The old insulator is now mainly used for electrical and heat insulation as well as PWR rods

## Changed
* Light oil and cracked light oil can now be refomred into large quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons a well as some reformate gas
* The painsaw ability no longer drops ammo and syringes, instead it drops nitra
* Radars have been completely rewritten
  * Dots will now move smoothly across the screen, instead of jittering and being bound to the pixel grid
  * Radars no longer use CPU-intensive full scans of the map, instead of using an optimized search for nearby scannable entities
  * There's now a dedicated toggle for detecing artillery shells
  * Radars now have a local area map that can be enabled
    * The map scans up to 100 points per tick, the display can show 40,000 points
    * The map will scan loaded chunks instantly, unloaded chunks have a limit of 5 chunk loads per tick to prevent excessive lag
    * The chunk load limit can be adjusted in the machine config file
    * The map will show terrain height between Y:50 and Y:128, anything outside that range is truncated
* The turbofan's afterburner now adds a 33% efficiency bonus for every level. This means that instead of the efficiency remaining constant between levels, a tier 3 upgrade will yield double efficiency.
* Reduced the flarestack's base energy efficiency
* Trenchmaster armor is now unbreakable
* The arc welder recipe for advanced circuits now uses simple insulator instead of gold dust
* The arc welder recipes for enhanced and advanced circuits now use only 100mB of fluid instead of 250mB
* Completely rewrote the missile base code, missiles now accelerate smoothly instead of in increments and use interpolated movement, making them less jittery
* Missiles now have a slightly higher top-speed
* Remodeled the anti-ballistic missile
* Anti-ballistic missiles now use predictive targeting as well as a heightened sensor range of 1,000 blocks (instead of 500) which should make them a lot more effective
* Anti-ballistic missiles accelerate 4x faster than normal missiles and have a 50% higher top-speed
* PWRs that have recently been close to unloaded chunks now have a 40 tick timeframe where they are "frozen", only trying to connect to a fluid network but not doing any fission, this should reduce the amount of meltdowns caused by chunkloading

## Fixed
* Fixed thorium bedrock ore using the wrong ore dict key, making it unable to be processed via centrifuge or acidizer
* Fixed custom machine NEI slots going out of bounds after the third slot
* Fixed bismuth billets not being oredicted, making BFB PWR rods uncraftable
* Fixed missile chunkloading having rounding issues, sometimes causing them to get stuck in unloaded chunks while crossing chunk borders
* Fixed drones not being listed in the creative tabs
* Fixed pre-defined fluid duct items not being being able to be placed where replacable blocks are, eg. water
