## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Changed the recipe change button on the mixer to be bright red with arrows on it (since the "C" looked too much like it meant "clear")
* The refinery and the vacuum refinery now have working recipe configs
* Recipe autogen for foundry casting now deprioritizes fragments, preventing them from being casted when nuggets of that material are available

## Fixed
* Fixed atomic clock precision assembler recipe not working
* Fixed ICF parts using 528 mode templates in normal mode
* Fixed arc furnace queue slots inserting too many items, causing the output to exceed max stack size
