## Changed
* Rad absorbers now use metadata, existing blocks will be converted automatically
* Fissure bombs that go off in crater biomes now create fissures with metadata 1 which creates radioactive volcanic lava
  * If a crater biome is created on top of an existing fissue, it will keep producing normal volcanic lava
