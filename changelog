## Added
* `/ntmserver`
  * Functions like `/ntmclient` but for common settings
  * Can toggle `DAMAGE_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`, off by default, enables a more compatible (but slightly jankier) version of the bullet damage code
  * `MINE_<xxx>_DAMAGE` can be used to adjust landmine damage
  * `TAINT_TRAILS` now replaces the hardcore taint config option, making taint blocks more potent and the potion effect trail taint blocks

## Changed
* Fat mines now use the standardized mini nuke code
  * Fat mines now have a base damage of exactly 100, being identical to demolition mini nukes
  * Fat mines now gib affected entities
* IV bags now use `setHealth` operations instead of dealing damage, preventing health duplication by just avoiding the damage
* The settings tool can now copy and paste the "paint" from paintable cables and fluid ducts
* Changed the way taint works
  * Instead of neon purple vines, taint is bow a greyish sludge
  * Taint now actively replaces blocks instead of growing along them
  * Taint is still limited in spread, however taint spread is lower underground, taint decays three times faster in intensity if the block is not exposed to air, making taint spread more along the surface
  * Taint has a 25% chance of splashing down when replacing a block with no supports, causing structures to collapse and taint to spread faster
  * Similar to soil sand, entities will sink in taint and get slowed down
  * The sludge consumeth
* `enableGuns` config option now applies to SEDNA system guns, simply canceling all gun-related keybinds
* Cinnabar dust, if registered by another mod, can now be acidized into cinnabar using hydrogen peroxide
* Copper wires, like AA and gold, can now be welded into dense wires

## Fixed
* Fixed animation error on the MAS-36
* Fixed drone docks, requester and provider crates not dropping their contents when broken
* Fixed all missing texture errors that appear in the startup log
* Potentially fixed a crash with mekanism during the recipe change phase
