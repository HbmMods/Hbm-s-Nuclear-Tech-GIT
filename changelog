## Added
* Conveyor press
  * An upgraded version of the electric press that can be integrated directly into conveyor belts
  * Each pressing operation will process however many items happen to be at the belt at the time, so given enough conveyor infrastructure it can be much faster than a normal electric press
  * Has no GUI, stamps are installed either by hand or via automation
  * Stamps can be removed with a screwdriver
  * Can only stamp single items to avoid issues with stack limits, so it's best to use ejection speed instead of stack ejection upgrades for the conveyor ejectors

## Changed
* Chlorophyte rounds now deal 2x more damage than their standard counterparts instead of 1.5x
* Chlorophyte rounds now penetrate multiple enemies
* Decreased chlorophyte targeting range from 200 to 30 blocks
* Josh now has recoil and reload animations
* Anvil recipes for upgrading ammo types have been adjusted to match the crafting batch size
* Adjusted the corium block destruction function to be more in line with the recent concrete nerfs
* Reduced the blast resistance threshold for FEL, making concrete once again resistant to lasers
* Crafting bullet assemblies now only yields one item, it's that one assembly that turns into a full set of bullets after being pressed once. This should reduce the amount of press operations by up to a factor of 64.
* 5mm assemblies now yield 64 instead of 32 bullets
* The production complexity and time for making thermoelectric elements in the assembler has been reduced
* Thermoelectric elements can now also be made in a tier 2 anvil
* Changed electric press recipe, crafting complexity has been reduced and the press now uses hydraulic pistons
* Removed DFC emitter beam cap again since the core already imposes a natural limit due to fuel consumption
  * I don't know why anyone would need a DFC that strong anyway, but now you can have them again
* The UAC pistol now has a crafting recipe and can also be found in structures

## Fixed
* Fixed logspam when pollution handler tries to save the pollution data for dimensions that have never been loaded before
* Fixed dead leaves layer not being replacable by other blocks
* Fixed rock layers like schist, hematite and sulfur caves not spawning at all
* Fixed rock layers replacing end portal frames or bedrock
* Fixed FEnSU instantly voiding all energy when sending
* Fixed some conflict causing the nuke flash to be applied permanently
* Fixed flux level not resetting when rods are above melting point with meltdowns disabled
* Fixed crash caused by express delivery shells
* Fixed 4 gauge solid steel slugs not being made from steel
* Fixed missing lang entry for fluorite ore
* Fixed UAC pistol UV
