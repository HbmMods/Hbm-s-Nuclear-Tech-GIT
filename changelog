## Added
* Boxcables
  * Like boxducts, but for power

## Changed
* Updated chinese localization
* Updated meteors
  * Meteors will now punch through weak blocks like leaves instead of getting stuck on trees
  * Meteor impacts now have new visuals
  * Falling meteors will produce a sound instead of stealthily blowing people up
  * Fallen meteors will now be placed deeper into the actual crater instead of hovering awkwardly over the hole
* Addd QMAW pages for the particle accelerator parts along with a PA overview page and a simple step by step construction tutorial
* Increased the acidizer partitioner's input limit from 9 to 45 slots
* Ammo containers are now functional again
  * Each gun has a fixed "default ammo" that will be given
  * Grants ammo for up to three held guns, selected randomly
  * Ammo given does not respect caliber conversion mods
  * Amount of ammo given depends on the mag size and type of ammo
    * Most pistols and low capacity rifles will get two reloads worth of ammo
    * High capacity rifles will typically get only one magazine
    * Rocket launchers typically only get a small amount of rockets
    * The fat man only gets a single nuke
    * Certain legendaries do not give ammo at all, they are omitted when three randomly held guns are selected
* Ammo containers are now found in more itempools
* The arc furnace input queue can now be moved into the recipe grid if the lid is at least slightly open instead of requiring a fully opened lid
  * This means that in system with slow input, the time window when items can be added to the arc furance is now more forgiving
* Pipe anchors now have a look overlay showing the currently configured fluid type
* Removed ammo duping using nitra, instead, four large piles can now be combined into an ammo container
  * Ammo containers crafted from nitra cannot give "expensive" ammo types
  * This mainly excludes mini nukes and .35
* Using a defuser, creepers can now be rendered harmless manually
* Defusing creepers now also works if the creeper hasn't lit its fuse yet
* Defused creepers are now permanently harmless, they can no longer be manually re-ignited at all
* Manual defusers now also affect big man johnson
  * Defusing only works if the timer is active
  * The glpyhid will explode instantly, but only about as powerful as a conventional rocket, not destroying blocks
  * Doing so will also drop one usable demolition mini nuke
* The painsaw ability no longer plays the blood splash particle effect
  * Instead, it will outright gib the target
* Pile plutonium rods can now be reprocessed in the PUREX in addition to the old anvil recipes
  * The recipes require 100mB of sulfuric acid and 100HE/t, the lowest requirement for all reprocessing recipes
  * The recipes are part of a shared auto switch group, meaning that even if different rod types are produced, only one PUREX is necessary
* Grass is no longer a valid paint block for paintable cables and ducts
* Multiblocks are no longer affected by collapses caused by nuclear explosions
* The old NITAN powder chests have been removed
  * In their place, there's now a different, more useful structure with similar but not identical spawn rules
* ROR controller torches can now set the threshold of particle accelerator dipoles
* Removed the legacy recipes from the terra drills
* Slag can now be cast into ingots
* Re-solidifcation of bedrock ore crumbs now requires ore slop instead of nitric acid
  * Due to ore slop being only obtainable from processing raw bedrock ore, this places a hard cap on how many times a single ore can be re-solidified out of crumbs
  * This approach means that crumb yields don't have to be nerfed, and prevents that issue from popping up again should there ever be a new, more efficient processing path
* Rewrote the ore layer generator (hematite, bauxite) to be way more performant during worldgen
* The mining laser can now be stopped by applying a redstone signal to one of the ports

## Fixed
* Fixed arc furnace only allowing electrodes to be inserted when the lid is down instead of up
* Fixed issue where the `amounts` tracker wasn't being used correctly when using a custom acidizer config, preventing the acidizer partitioner from working
* Fixed multi fluid ID search potentially not working on systems with a non-latin locale
* Fixed particle accelerator source working even if not cooled
* Fixed foundry channels being overly laggy in certain setups
* Fixed potential mod incompatibilities with world generation mods that use outdated forge hooks
* Fixed the buzzsaw not properly replanting trees using the `leaves2` block type
* Fixed creepers regaining their exploding AI task upon relog, if defused
* Fixed assembly and chemical factories not properly saving their recipe fluid buffers
* Fixed light blue and light gray dyes not working when dyeing cables
* Fixed bismuth armor not having a valid repair material
* Fixed compressors needing at least one mB of fluid more to process a recipe than necessary
* Fixed many NTM structure spawn conditions being hardcoded (again) preventing them from spawning in modded biomes that would otherwise be a fit
* Fixed spawn offset for some structures which caused them to float in the air
