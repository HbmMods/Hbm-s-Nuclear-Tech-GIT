## Added
* Target pistol
  * Weapon steel tier pistol that holds 15 rounds and shoots .22 LR
  * Accepts silencers

## Changed
* Reworked the industrial turbine
  * New model and texture
  * Removed the GUI, it now uses the same in-world compressor toggle as the leviathan turbine
  * No longer has a volatile power buffer, power isn't buffered at all anymore, similar to steam engines and MHD turbines
  * Steam capacity changes based on compression level, the ratio for turbine cascades is now 1:1:1:1
  * Comes with a flywheel, energy output slowly ramps up as steam is supplied and slowly goes down as steam cuts out
* Leviathan turbines no longer have a power buffer
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* The PWR can now be controlled via RoR
  * The RoR value reader can read core and hull heat as well as fuel depletion in percent
  * The RoR controller can set the control rod level in percent as well as jetison all loaded fuel

# Fixed
* Fixed proxy tiles that do not use electricity at all visually connecting to cables
