## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Large deposits (hematite, malachite, bauxite) and caves (sulfur, asbestos) can now be toggled in the config
* Removed recipes for most old particle accelerator parts
* Dense coils no longer have recipes either for the most part, all coils with no recipes can be recycled back into dense wires
* Natural gas can now be processed in a pyrolysis oven, 12k of gas yields 8k hydrogen and one graphite ingot
* Saturnite now has an alternate recipe, adding one pile of borax for doubled output
* All mass storage units (except wood) are now substantially cheaper
* Reduced base spread for all 12 and 10 gauge buckshot shells from 0.05 to 0.035
* Reduced legendary 12 lever action's spread multiplier from x1.35 to x1.15

## Fixed
* Fixed an issue where `/ntmreload` would load fluids after recipes, meaning that recipes using newly added fluids would not work correctly, as the fluids don't exist by the time the recipe is loaded
* Fixed bedrock coltan being way too common, drowning out almost all other bedrock ores
* Fixed rotary furnace not saving its output stack
* Fixed strand caster water check being incorrect, creating negative water by allowing operations with insufficient cooling
* Fixed radar not using the small remaining amount of power, causing the animation getting stuck
