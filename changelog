## Added
* Infinite ammo bag
  * Identical to the regular ammo bag, but ammo is never depleted
  * Provides 9,999 units of ammo for the purposes of reloading/belts, meaning that even a single bullet in the bag allows a full reload
  * Obviously creative-only

## Changed
* Nerfed AP and DU round damage multiplier
  * Effective damage is still much higher than on gunmetal ammo due to the armor piercing effect
* Increased flamethrower turret detection range from 32 to 48 blocks
* Flamethrower turrets and chemthrower now use the green fire effect when using balefire fuel
* Flamethrower turret projectile damage is now capped to 20
  * Balefire fuel should no longer instantly vaporize bosses
* Tobacco and Hemp plants are now biome tinted and are no longer radioactive green
* Most chemthrower ammo types with variable damage output are now capped to 15 damage per shot (that is still a ton)
* Chemthrower combustible liquids now use SEDNA type fire particles
* Halved recoil on the zebra rifle
* The laser pistols now make a click when dry firing
* Solid fuel in the rotary furnace no longer ticks down if no recipe is actually being done
* Pneumatic tube round robin will now progress even if a destination is not accessible, preventing cases where the tubes are stuck if one of the containers has run full
* Tesla cannons now accept low-wavelength capacitors
  * The resulting beam is non-penetrating and 20% less powerful than standard capacitor beams
  * In addition to the splash damage, the beam will split and fire smaller beams at any living entity in a 20 block radius, with half damage
  * Sub-beams do not cause splash damage
  * Sub-beams will strike the initially hit entity again, meaning that the more sub-beams there are, the more powerful the initial strike ends up being
* Renamed the default capacitor ammo to "capacitor (standard)" to avoid confusion

## Fixed
* Fixed a potential crash caused by cargo dropships landing on cargo docks with no satellite chip installed
* Fixed potential crash related to hazard handling for dropped items
* Fixed errors thrown when loading in old system bullet entities
* Fixed dupe regarding breaking transport drones
* Fixed 12 gauge flechette DT negation not being the intended value
* Fixed carbine mistakenly showing a round being chambered even after firing the last loaded round
