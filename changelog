## Changed
* Added more QMAW pages
* Removed most old particle accelerator blocks from the creative inventory
* All dual wielded guns now render more accurately when dropped instead of only showing one gun
* Added support for left handed guns (currently unused)*
* Removed the presentations for the old particle accelerator and schottky diode

## Fixed
* Fixed wood burner only being able to create one ash pile per item burned, even when that item yields more, creating a backlog in the internal ash value
