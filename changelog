## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Rad absorbers now use metadata, existing blocks will be converted automatically
* Fissure bombs that go off in crater biomes now create fissures with metadata 1 which creates radioactive volcanic lava
  * If a crater biome is created on top of an existing fissure, it will keep producing normal volcanic lava
* Simplified the battery socket's client packets, reducing CPU load
* Muzzle flashes on guns now work in third person mode, including on other players and on NPCs, making it more apparent when you're being fired at
  * This includes non-standard special effects like the .44 gap flash and the .35-800 ejector plume
* Removed the old unused satellite deco blocks, freeing up 6 block IDs
* Crucibles that smelt metal with no template set will no place the metal in the recipe stack instead of the waste stack, this should make it easier to get a recipe to work in the many, many cases where people add the template after smelting the material
* Battery sockets and the FENSU now support the copy tool
* Removed unused displaylist support from the model loader
  * DLs have been long phased out in favor of VBOs anyway
* Rebranded canned horse slime
  * Now with extra bone marrow
* Updated the deuterium tower's model
* Updated most blast door visuals
* RBMKs now have QMAW pages
* Updated the model on the heavy magnetic storage container
* Increased the power draw on the osmiridium welding recipe
* Bullet casings now make sounds when falling to the ground
* Most ammo types now have QMAW pages, including information on whether or not they are a war crime
* Both assembly and chemical factories now have four special ports that only allow items inserted to go into one recipe group
* All models using the HFR wavefront loader can now be hot-swapped via resource reload (F3 + T)
* Updated most door models
  * Door skins are no longer a dedicated item, the skin can be changed using a screwdriver
  * Available skins are cycled through in the item preview
  * Fire doors and secure access doors no longer use clipping planes (i.e. making the doors not render outside of their frames)
  * Vault doors have been ported to the current door system, the blocks should convert automatically

# Fixed
* Potentially fixed yet another issue regarding crates
* Fixed battery socket `fillpercent` RoR function always assuming a max power of 1
* Fixed issue where multiblock ports would generate many OpenComputers component entries
* Fixed RBMK automatic control rods having incorrect settings when using the copy tool
* Fixed battery sockets producing junk debug data in the logs
* Fixed an issue where the charging station would crash when trying to charge certain items
* Fixed the DFC's core component not dropping its contents when mined
* Fixed audio problems with guns
* Fixed third person muzzleflash on the miniguns clipping the barrel
* Fixed arc furnace IO slots stacking items with incompatible NBT
* Fixed a bounding box issue with casing particles, causing them to slide sideways on the first tick, making trajectories weird
* Fixed some turrets not using the more modern casing spawner system which allows casings to have a smoke trail
* Fixed incorrect tooltip on the upgrade stat screen for assembly factories
* Fixed crash caused by RBMK overpressure meltdown mechanic
* Fixed a crash causing by the charging station in combination with the new battery packs
* Fixed a broken and originally unintended feature where the flamethrower turret would be loadable using regular item tanks
  * Most ammo slots now work for loading, the empty canisters are returned via the fluid ID slot
* Fixed a dupe regarding conveyors
