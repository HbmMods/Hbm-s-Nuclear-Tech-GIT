## Added
* Pigeons
* Wood burner
  * Replaces the old combustion generator
  * A larger machine, has higher efficiency when burning logs or planks
  * Collects ashes at the same rate as ashpits
  * Also has an option to burn flammable liquids at 50% efficiency
* `/ntmrad`
  * `set` operator can change the radiation amount in the current chunk
  * `clear` operator will remove the radiation data from all loaded chunks
* Dense wires
  * Can be made in a crucible
  * Material cost is equivalent to 1 ingot
  * For ease of mass-production, 9-fold molds are also available
  * Used to craft hadron magnets, reducing crafting complexity be removing annoying upgrade recipes which make automation more complicated and needlessly inflate the amount of materials required for a magnet tier that isn't even the one that's being made

## Changed
* Changed many tool recipes that exclusively used polymer to now also accept bakelite
* Reduced the value of hematite and malachite blocks in the crucible down to one ingot
  * Hematite veins are still giant, so a single vein will still yield many stacks of iron
  * Malachite's rebalance was done to be consistent with the bedrock ores which now exist. Malachite veins are now larger to compensate.
* 1000mB of red mud now makes one ingot of iron in the coker
* Doubled coal bedrock ore's coal output to 8 coal
* A new config option now replaces the iron and copper bedrock ores in 528 mode with hematite and malachite
* the industrial generator now has three additional ports on its underside, meaning it is now a lot easier to properly automate all necessary IO
* Neodymium is now a valid crucible material
* Particle accelerators will now evenly distribute items using IO if both inputs are equal, making the antischrabidium recipe a lot easier to automate
* Due to multiple complaints regarding the plastic bag's ability to contain radiation, plastic bags now *double* the radiation of the item they contain
* The post impact spawning restrictions have changed, meaning that spawning things with spawn eggs is no longer broken. Due to technical limitations, this means that post impact, no mobs will spawn as part of world gen, only via random spawns.
* All energy storage blocks now have a fixed transfer limit of 5% of their capacity per tick, reducing the impact of ping-ponging considerably

## Fixed
* Pipe and power networks now force the chunk to be saved on transfer, ensuring that rapid changes in the fluid/energy level aren't lost when the tile entity is unloaded
