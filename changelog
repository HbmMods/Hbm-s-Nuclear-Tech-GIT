## Added
* New battery system
  * Energy storage blocks, capacitors and battery items are now deprecated, but can still be used
  * There is now new types of battery items, as well as capacitor items
  * Instead of energy storage blocks, there is now a battery socket, which allows those new items to be connected to the power grid
  * Battery sockets act like cables, they will connect power grids when two cables are plugged into them in different directions
  * Self-chargers and creative batteries are still around, as well as spark batteries which are needed for the balefire bomb
  * The FEnSU has been replaced by a much larger version with unlimited energy storage
* `/ntmreapnetworks`
  * Deletes all active nodespace instances
  * Mainly useful for server owners, in case nodespace builds up too much garbage data that isn't cleared correctly
* Fluid valve with counter
  * Reads total fluid movement within a network
  * Value can be read or reset with OC or RoR
  * Allows for very precise portioning and fluid control

## Changed
* Updated italian localization
* After not being part of worldgen for a long time, oily coal is finally being removed
* The rare metal blocks that had been unobtainable and unused for the longest time have been removed
* The schrabidium transmutator's grace period is over, it is finally being destroyed
* Most of the legacy fusion reactor components, which were unobtainable and unusable, have been removed
  * The block ID economy is looking better than ever
* Infinite water barrels can now be crafted with any water container and not just buckets
* OpenComputers integration for the PWR can now also read the heat capacity stats
* Removed the restriction that demands that cluster ores need to be mined by hand
* Laser beams from energy weapons are now a lot more narrow
* All steam turbines now have a passive drain on unused power in their buffers

## Fixed
* Fixed meteors using a nonexistant keepalive timer, causing potential audio flickering in certain cases
* Fixed 528 coltan deposit config misspelling
* Potentially fixed a performance issue caused by transmission networks not being deleted when they have no active links
* Fixed multi output recipe objects not deserializing right, causing the precision assembler config to not load
* Fixed pedestal recipes not using the correct register option, making custom config files wipe all clay tablets
* Fixed custom fluids breaking when using the `/ntmreload` command
* Fixed power not saving for mining lasers
* Fixed the annihilator producing blank 528 mode blueprints when 528 mode isn't even enabled
* Fixed black fire not using the skeletonizer on death
* Fixed arc furnace electrodes not being able to be plugged into the arc furnace unless the lid is fully open
* Fixed broken keybind localization
