## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Rad absorbers now use metadata, existing blocks will be converted automatically
* Fissure bombs that go off in crater biomes now create fissures with metadata 1 which creates radioactive volcanic lava
  * If a crater biome is created on top of an existing fissure, it will keep producing normal volcanic lava
* Simplified the battery socket's client packets, reducing CPU load
* Muzzle flashes on guns now work in third person mode, including on other players and on NPCs, making it more apparent when you're being fired at
  * This includes non-standard special effects like the .44 gap flash and the .35-800 ejector plume
* Removed the old unused satelite deco blocks, freeing up 6 block IDs
* Crucibles that smelt metal with no template set will no place the metal in the recipe stack instead of the waste stack, this should make it easier to get a recipe to work in the many, many cases where people add the template after smelting the material
* Battery sockets and the FENSU now support the copy tool
* Removed unused displaylist support from the model loader
  * DLs have been long phased out in favor of VBOs anyway
* Rebranded canned horse slime
  * Now with extra bone marrow
* Updated the deuterium tower's model
