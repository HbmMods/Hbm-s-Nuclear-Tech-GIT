# Added
Core Features
------------
1. Multi-Segment Tower System
   - Added support for variable-height reactor towers
   - Implemented position detection (Top, Bottom, Middle segments)
   - Added tower height tracking
   - Each segment maintains its own state while part of the tower
   - Segments work together for enhanced efficiency
   - Automatic power distribution across segments

2. Special Pellet Integration
   - Full support for all Watz pellet types including:
     * Digamma (2000D yield, pink/magenta theme)
     * Test Object FOE (111)
     * XFE (Experimental Fusion)
     * Gold Series (GLDONE -> GLDTWO -> GLDSX -> GLDSY)
     * Antimatter-based pellets
   - Each pellet maintains unique properties and behaviors
   - Texture registration using ItemEnumMulti pattern
   - Support for variant textures using "iconString.variantName" format
   - Progressive power scaling with tower height

Crafting Recipes
---------------
1. Special Watz Pellets
   - Test Object FOE (111):
     * Schrabidium fuel + antimatter + nitan mix
     * Requires beryllium and lithium moderators
     * Experimental behavior in tower setup
   
   - Digamma:
     * Base: Schrabidium Watz Pellet
     * 2x Digamma particles
     * Starmetal for stability
     * Power powder instead of moderators
     * Extremely powerful 
     * Optimized for tower configuration
     * Changed parameters
   
   - XFE (Experimental Fusion):
     * Advanced alloy + power powder
     * Standard moderator configuration
     * Early-mid game fusion option
     * Balanced for tower setups
   
   - Gold Series (Progressive):
     * GLDONE -> GLDTWO -> GLDSX -> GLDSY
     * Each tier requires previous tier + AU198
     * Varying moderator requirements
     * Increasing power with each tier
     * Enhanced efficiency in tower formation
   
   - Antimatter:
     * Uses 2x antimatter particles
     * Standard moderator configuration
     * Ultimate power pellet
     * Maximum tower synergy effects

# Changes and Fixes
GUI Changes
----------
1. Tower Status Display
   - Added visual indicators for reactor tower segments
   - Each segment shows its position in the tower
   - Current segment is highlighted for easy identification
   - Tower height is visually represented
   - Removed middle segment numbering for cleaner interface
   - Interactive tooltips for tower information

2. TU Gauge Evolution
   Initial Implementation:
   - Used ROUND_SMALL gauge type
   - Position: (13, 100)
   - Heat calculation using logarithmic scaling
   - Color changes based on heat level

   Experimental Changes (Now Reverted):
   - Temporarily changed to smooth gauge style
   - Tested different gauge sizes and positions
   - Experimented with linear heat scaling
   - Tried different color schemes (0x7F0000, 0xFF3300, 0xFF0000)
   - Tested various needle lengths and thicknesses

   Final State (Reverted to Original):
   - Restored ROUND_SMALL gauge type
   - Restored original position (13, 100)
   - Restored logarithmic heat calculation:
     heat = 1 - (float) Math.log(watz.heat / 100_000D + 1) * 0.4F
   - Maintained original color scaling

Technical Implementation
----------------------
1. TileEntityWatz.java
   - Added tower status tracking variables
   - Implemented segment position detection
   - Added tower height calculation
   - Added serialization for network sync
   - Integrated special pellet handling
   - Tower efficiency calculations
   - Power distribution logic

2. GUIWatz.java
   - Implemented tower status visual display
   - Added segment indicators
   - Restored original TU gauge implementation
   - Maintained fluid tank rendering
   - Preserved power and lock status indicators
   - Enhanced tooltip system

3. Item Implementation
   - Extended ItemEnumMulti for variant handling
   - Implemented standard texture registration pattern
   - Added support for variant-specific textures
   - Optimized for multi-pellet support
   - Tower-aware behavior system

# Visual Effects & Hazards
-----------------------
1. Digamma Pellet Effects
   - Dynamic texture manipulation using TextureAtlasSpriteMutatable
   - Shaking effect with compound sine/cosine waves
   - Unique time offset per instance
   - Theme-appropriate colors (light: 0xFF1493, dark: 0xC71585)
   - No enchantment glow effect for performance
   - Enhanced visual feedback in tower setup

2. Contamination System
   - Digamma contamination when pellet is held in inventory
   - Uses ContaminationUtil.applyDigammaData
   - Rate: 0.005F per tick
   - Only affects player entities
   - Adds risk factor to handling Digamma pellets
   - Safety considerations for tower maintenance

Note: Watz Reactors Stacks are now working again. Fixed GUI bugs.
