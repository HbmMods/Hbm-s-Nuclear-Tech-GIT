## Added
* Asphalt stairs
  * Stairs, but fast
  * Slabs too
* More circuits
  * Control units and advanced control units are exclusively used for nukes
  * CUs and ACUs are quite a bit more expensive than standard circuits and also make use of tantalum capacitors
  * Nukes are no longer for people who weasel their way through progression and then get 8 uranium, 2 steel and some duct tape, instead every atomic bomb requires a large electronics production capacity
  * WMDs are expensive, who woulda thunk

## Changed
* Wires now use recipe autogen for anvils, meaning that all fine wires are now obtainable via tier 4 anvil
* Changed most nuke recipes
  * Most assembler recipes have been de-cluttered, no longer using random extra plates or wires
  * Nukes now exclusively use control units or ACUs instead of circuits
* CRTs are now crafted in the crafting table instead of via assembler, making use of vacuum tubes
* Chainlink fences now only create posts on edges or intersections
  * The new chainlink fence post block will always create a post, emulating the behavior of the old fences
* Removed gold sands (frees up 2 block IDs)
* There's now two new variants of builder's choice concrete, desert storm (the texture from the launch pad) and bronze plating (the old ICF laser texture)
* Microwaves are no longer electric furnace copies, instead their recipes are restricted to things considered food
* Electric furnaces now cause minor pollution (does not connect to smoke stacks!)
* Increased the arc furnace's liquid buffer to 128 blocks (from 24)
* The arc furnace can now accepts more items depending on the speed upgrade, extending all the way to 16 with speed 3 (effective cap might be lower to prevent outputs from exceeding 64 items)
  * Due to technical limitations, clicking into a slot once will only place a single item, however after the item is present, the slot's capacity extends to the upgraded size
  * This is especially apparent when clicking items into slots by hand, and still noticeable when shift clicking by how the items spread out
  * This does not affect automation at all, items will stack up nicely without spreading out unnecessarily
* Reduced arc furnace pollution from 15 to 10 soot per cycle
* The way soot spreads has been changed
  * The spreading threshold has been decreased from 15 to 10
  * Every update, soot will decrease by regardless of whether it can spread or not (instead of only if it cannot spread)

## Fixed
* Fixed dupe regarding conveyor grabbers
* Fixed soldering stations not saving progress or their fluid tanks
* Fixed a bug where missile debris would always spawn with a stack size of 1 and a meta of 0
* Fixed FM radios disassembling into incorrect parts
* Fixed 256k tanks yielding too much steel when shredded
* Fixed the wire mold only creating 1 wire instead of the intended 8 due to the changes to the wire oredict
