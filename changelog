## Added
* Industrial boiler
  * A slightly taller variant of the boiler with higher capacity
  * Unlike the regular boiler, it can't explode
* Redstone-over-radio counter
  * Can count and send the amount of an item stored in a container
  * Counting supports filters by item ID, ID+meta and ore dictionary names
  * Each torch can count up to three items and output the results on different channels
  * This allows for more precise control over things like assembler chests, like turning off the ejector for an item that is already full but not other ejectors
  * This property makes automating things with multiple inputs a lot easier
  * Due to the ore dictionary ability of the counter, buffered items can precisely match the requirements of the recipe
* Particle collider cooling unit
  * A block that can replace coils in a particle collider
  * Will increment a new "cooling" value which depletes over time and makes coils more effective
  * Overcooling causes a penalty, so coolers cannot be spammed and need to be carefully spaced out
  * Allows for even more compact particle accelerator setups
  * Comes in two tiers, both tiers use a different cooling variable with different effectiveness, the higher tier will override the lower tier if both tiers of coolers are present
* Benelli M4
  * Automatic 12 gauge shotgun with a drum mag

## Changed
* The regular boiler now only holds 16k instead of 64k (which is still a lot)
* Added labels to the large mining drill's levers
* Glyphid eggs can now be broken apart using an anvil, yielding glyphid meat, bones and experience bottles
* The assembler now uses the new multiblock system, making it less annoying to playe and less ear-piercing to break
  * The conversion happens automatically so it's not necessary to remove the assemblers beforehand
* Reload canceling is no longer possible if no rounds have been loaded yet, preventing single round weapons like dart guns to be reload canceled
* The saturnite rifle now has a functional scope
* Rechambered the bolt action rifles to 7.62mm, with a mag of 5 rounds

## Fixed
* Fixed quantity of the fusion reactor's construction recipe not being displayed right
* Fixed fluid valve and redstone fluid valves having the wrong names
* Fixed mobs' max health getting buffed by pollution, but the actual health staying the same
* Fixed bug regarding the loot pools of satellite miners
