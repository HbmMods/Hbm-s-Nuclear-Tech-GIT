## Changed
* Material autogen now creates redstone in ingot form, allowing smaller than block quantities to be cast
* Removed the ancient ZPE blocks
* Drone hitboxes are now way smaller, which should cause them to get stuck when flying less
* The new FENSU now keeps its charge and installed muffler when broken
* Battery sockets are now compatible with comparator output

## Fixed
* Fixed the FEnSU, cyclotron and reliant robin missile being uncraftable due to stacksize limitations

* Fixed yet another issue regarding addon fluids breaking on recipe reload
* Fixed YET ANOTHER issue regarding crates, AGAIN
* Fixed a rare issue where the fusion reactor could have negative fuel
* Fixed battery socket priority tooltip offset
