## Changed
* Making LPG in the compressor now requires two compression steps
  * This fixes an issue where polymer is unobtainable in 528 mode since petroleum at 1PU not being obtainable
* Fire and cryo damage now bypasses glyphid's armor, being unaffected by the armor's damage reduction and not being able to break off armor either

  * Once the target is already frozen, it will deal damage and apply the same effects as it used to
