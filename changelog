## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Rad absorbers now use metadata, existing blocks will be converted automatically
* Fissure bombs that go off in crater biomes now create fissures with metadata 1 which creates radioactive volcanic lava
  * If a crater biome is created on top of an existing fissue, it will keep producing normal volcanic lava
* Simplified the battery socket's client packets, reducing CPU load
* Muzzle flashes on guns now work in third person mode, including on other players and on NPCs, making it more apparent when you're being fired at
  * This includes non-standard special effects like the .44 gap flash and the .35-800 ejector plume

# Fixed
* Potentially fixed yet another issue regarding crates
* Fixed battery socket `fillpercent` RoR function always assuming a max power of 1
* Fixed issue where multiblock ports would generate many OpenComputers component entries
* Fixed RBMK automatic control rods having incorrect settings when using the copy tool
