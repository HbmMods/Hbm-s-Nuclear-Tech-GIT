## Added
* Pigeons

## Changed
* Changed many tool recipes that exclusively used polymer to now also accept bakelite
* Reduced the value of hematite and malachite blocks in the crucible down to one ingot
  * Hematite veins are still giant, so a single vein will still yield many stacks of iron
  * Malachite's rebalance was done to be consistent with the bedrock ores which now exist. Malachite veins are now larger to compensate.
* 1000mB of red mud now makes one ingot of iron in the coker
* Doubled coal bedrock ore's coal output to 8 coal
* A new config option now replaces the iron and copper bedrock ores in 528 mode with hematite and malachite

## Fixed
* Pipe and power networks now force the chunk to be saved on transfer, ensuring that rapid changes in the fluid/energy level aren't lost when the tile entity is unloaded
