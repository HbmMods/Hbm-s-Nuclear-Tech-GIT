## Changed
* For consistency with the crucible material, all tantalium *items* now go by "tantalum"

## Fixed
* Fixed MHD turbines requiring a 528 blueprint in normal mode
  * The game will now crash when the default pool list has a 528 blueprint entry, preventing this from happening again
  * Configured recipes do not have this check, you can use 528 mode templates in normal mode if you really want for some reason
* Fixed ancient misspelling of "ketamine" on the splash screens
* Fixed tantalum fragments not using autogen correctly, becoming unusable
* Fixed 528 mode cracking tower requiring rubber instead of plasic for the blueprint, rendering it unobtainable
