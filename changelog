## Changed
* Updated boxducts
  * All boxducts are now way cleaner, only having bolts on intersections, with straight parts only having very light seams
  * Intersections now have unique textures for each size
  * Copper boxducts now have a much nicer color gradient
  * Exhaust pipes now have a more rusted appearance
* Added an alternate recipe for blank upgrades using integrated circuits and polymer instead of analog circuits
* Update the soyuz and orbital module recipes
  * Simplified the recipes, fewer microcrafting parts
  * Both now use low-density elements which are made from aluminium/titanium, fiberglass and hard plastic
  * Both now make use of more advanced electronics, although in smaller numbers
* Removed the recipes for the satellite deco blocks, those will be phased out soon. Existing deco blocks can still be crafted back into functional satellites
* Moved the satellite recipes to the welder, the attachment is now welded onto the common satellite body
* Simplified the satellite recipes, adjusted cost based on utility (depth scanner, death ray and resonator are more expensive than the mapper/radar)
* CTRL + ALT view now shows the item's internal name and domain
* Adjusted Mekanism compat
  * Decreased crafting complexity and time for the digiminer assembler recipe
  * Replaced recipes for the wind turbine and atomic disassembler
  * Added a config option for toggling Mekanism compat
* Added recipe caching to the combinator funnel, meaning it no longer has to iterate over the entire recipe list all the time for compression/automation, this should improve performance by a fair bit
* Diodes now use silicon nuggets instead of nether quartz
* Aluminium wire's coloring is now consistent with the ingot

## Fixed
* Fixed crash caused by PRISM updating unloaded worlds
* Hopefully fixed another crash caused by PRISM (reproduction was unreliable and sporadic, not confirmed)
