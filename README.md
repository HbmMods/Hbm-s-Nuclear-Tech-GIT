## Downloading pre-compiled versions from GitHub

Simply navigate to "Releases" on the right side of the page, download links for the compiled JAR as well as the corresponding source code are under the "Assets" category below the changelog. Make sure to review all changelogs when updating!

## Building from source

Tired of waiting until the next version comes out? Here is a tutorial on how to compile the very newest version yourself:
Please note that these installation instructions are assuming you're running Microsoft Windows operating system. Linux users should know what to do by looking at the same guide.

 1. Make sure you have JDK8 installed. If not, download it from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
 2. If you don't have git installed, download&install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
 3. Open up "Git Bash":
    * Press Windows Button, type "Git Bash" and press ENTER
 4. Enter the directory where you would like the sources to be (advanced users can use any directory)
 ```bash
     cd $HOME/Downloads
 ```
 5. Download the source code:
 ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT.git
 ```
 4. Enter the source code directory
 ```bash
     cd Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT
 ```
 5. Build the mod
 ```bash
     ./gradlew build
 ```
 6. Locate the mod file.
    1. Open up your file explorer.
    2. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the sources.
       * If you exactly followed step 1, it should be `C:/Users/%USER%/Downloads`.
    3. Enter the downloaded source tree.
    4. Navigate to `build/libs`.
    5. Grab the "HBM-NTM-<version>.jar" one.
        * This is your mod file. You can install it like any other mod by putting it into your mods directory.

## Contributing
If you want to make some changes to the mod, follow this guide:
1. Follow steps 1-2 from *Building from source* section
2. Create a directory where the repository will reside, using a name that is not "Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT"
3. Download the forge src from [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) and extract it into the directory.
4. Download the source code:
  * Using Git Bash, enter wherever your directory is located:
```bash
    cd $HOME/Downloads
```
   * Download the source code:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT.git
 ```
   * Move or copy every file within the new folder into your directory, making sure to overwrite any files.
   * Feel free to delete the remaining folder and rename your directory (such as "Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT")
5. Enter the source directory
```bash
    cd Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT
```
6. Setup forge decompilation workspace
```bash
    ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
### Necessary for Eclipse users
7. Generate eclipse files
```bash
    ./gradlew eclipse
```
8. Switch to the **eclipse** folder inside your directory as a workspace.
9. If necessary, make sure that Eclipse is using the JDK8.
   * On Linux, enter Windows>Preferences>Java>Installed JREs.
      * Click search to navigate to /usr/lib/jvm and open it. Select the Java 8 JDK (e.g., java-8-openjdk).
      * Afterwards, enter Execution Environment, select JavaSE-1.8, and select the jre listed as a **[perfect match]**
   * On Windows, you may need to set your JAVA_HOME.
      * Search for Environment Variables and click Edit the System Environment Variables.
      * Click Environment Variables. Click new under System Variables.
      * Enter **JAVA_HOME** under Variable Name and enter the path to your JDK 8 under Variable Value (e.g., C:\Program-Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_102).
      * In Eclipse, now enter Windows>Preferences>Java>Installed JREs.
      * Click **Add Standard VM**; in the JRE home, navigate to the directory where the JDK is installed, then click finish and select it.
