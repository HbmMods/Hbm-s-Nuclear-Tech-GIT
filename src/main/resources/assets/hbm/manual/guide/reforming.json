Mainly, it is used to convert [[naphtha|Naphtha]] into [[reformate|Reformate]] and [[petroleum gas|Petroleum Gas]]. [[Reformate gas|Reformate Gas]] and [[aromatic hydrocarbons|Aromatic Hydrocarbons]] are obtained by the reforming of [[light oil|Light Oil]]. Reforming of petroleum gas yields reformate gas and [[unsaturated hydrocarbons|Unsaturated Hydrocarbons]].<br><br>Additionally, [[sour gas|Sour Gas]] can be reformed to obtain [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric Acid]]."
