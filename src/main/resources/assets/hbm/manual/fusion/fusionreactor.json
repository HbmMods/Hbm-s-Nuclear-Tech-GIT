Depending on its purpose, power-generating parts such as boilers and MHDTs, or byproduct-yielding parts like collectors and breeders may be added.<br><br>More advanced setups may employ couplers to create the energy needed to ignite higher-tier plasmas, creating a setup with two ore more toruses. Byproducts from lower stages can be used for certain higher tier plasma types, so one torus may provide both ignition energy and fuel for another."
