		"en_US": "\"Torus\", main component of the [[fusion reactor|Fusion Reactor]], uses fuel and energy from a [[klystron|Klystron]] to generate plasma. Also requires electricity and cooling via [[perfluoromethyl|Perfluoromethyl]] to operate.<br><br>Features four connection ports for external components. Devices that use plasma energy (and not just neutron flux) split the total output, a single component will receive 100% of the energy, two components will receive 62.5% each and three components get 50% each. Therefore, using multiple [[boilers|Fusion Reactor Boiler]] or [[MHDTs|MHD Turbine]] increases the total energy output, although with diminishing returns. Flux levels are not affected when shared, the output remains steady across all ports no matter how many attachments are used.<br><br>Both the buffered electric charge and fuel levels determine working speed, if either is below 50%, the reactor will start to throttle, burnng slower and decreasing output energy. The klystron energy does not affect processing speed, too little energy will simply fail to ignite the plasma, and more energy will not accelerate the reaction."
