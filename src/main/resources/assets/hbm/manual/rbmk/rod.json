		"en_US": "The RBMK fuel channel is the most important part of the [[RBMK]] since it holds the [[fuel|RBMK Fuel Rod]], allowing the reaction to happen. Neutron flux created by the fuel will be emitted in four cardinal directions, with a maximum range of five blocks.<br><br>Moderated fuel channels are almost identical to the standard version, except that incoming fast flux will be converted into slow flux, similar to how [[moderators|RBMK Graphite Moderator]] work, although outgoing flux is not affected.<br><br>The [[ReaSim fuel channel|RBMK Fuel Channel (ReaSim)]] is an alternate version of the RBMK fuel channel with different neutron spread mechanics."
