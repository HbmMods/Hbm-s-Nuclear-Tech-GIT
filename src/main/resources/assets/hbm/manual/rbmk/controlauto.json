		"en_US": "Automatic control rods, unlike the standard [[RBMK control rods|RBMK Control Rods]], cannot be controlled manually, instead they can be configured to adjust their insertion level based on their own component heat. A minimum and maximum heat, along with a minimum and maximum level which correspond to those values can be set, as well as a curve which defines the behavior between those levels.<br><br>It is possible, but not recommended, to have a reactor that runs solely on automatic control rods. They do see occasional use for smoothing out reaction spikes and for controlling the neutron sources on subcritical reactors."
