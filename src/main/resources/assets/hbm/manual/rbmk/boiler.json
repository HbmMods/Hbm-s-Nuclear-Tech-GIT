		"en_US": "The RBMK steam channel is the primary way for the [[RBMK]] to be cooled, and to extract energy from it. The steam channel will use as much water as it can at once to cool itself down to the target temperature, i.e. the temperature of the steam type that is configured in the compressor. Since [[fuel channels|RBMK Fuel Channel]] are the only parts in the RBMK that actively heat up, it's recommended to put the steam channels as close as possible to them. Like most RBMK components, the steam channels do not block neutrons, so they can be connected cardinally to fuel channels.<br><br>The compressor settings allow higher density steam to be output, however, higher density steam is hotter, which means that the steam channel's ability to cool is limited. Despite this, higher density steam means that more water can flow through the channel, increasing the amount of cooling that can be done. In practice, most reactors will work fine with regular uncompressed steam. The compressor can be configured remotely via the [[console|RBMK Console]].<br><br>The steam channel only accepts water from the bottom and outputs steam at the top. Using an [[RBMK steam connector|RBMK Steam Connector]], both fluids can be handled from the bottom.",
		"zh_CN": "RBMK蒸汽管道是冷却[[RBMK]]和通过RBMK发电的主要方式。 蒸汽管道会使用尽可能多的水将自身冷却至目标温度（即设定的蒸汽压缩等级 对应的蒸汽的温度）。[[燃料通道|RBMK Fuel Channel]]是RBMK中唯一能够主动产热的部件， 因此建议将蒸汽管道放置在距离燃料通道尽量近的地方。与大多数RBMK部件 类似，蒸汽管道不会阻挡中子，因此其可以与燃料通道直接接触。<br><br>通过调整蒸汽压缩等级可以使蒸汽管道输出高等级蒸汽，但高等级蒸汽温度更 高，进而会使得蒸汽管道的冷却能力受到限制；然而，蒸汽压缩等级更高也意 味着蒸汽管道中的水流量更大，这又提高了冷却总量。在实际操作中，大多数 反应堆都能在使用普通蒸汽时正常工作。蒸汽压缩等级可通过[[控制台|RBMK Console]]远程调整。<br><br>蒸汽管道只从底部接收水并从顶部输出蒸汽，使用[[RBMK蒸汽导出器|RBMK Steam Connector]]可 使两种流体都能从底部输入输出。"
