book.rbmk.cover=My first RBMK:$Basics of$building a$reactor
book.rbmk.title1=Introduction
book.rbmk.page1=§lRBMK§r is fully modular nuclear reactor. Unlike most other reactors, there is no "core" and no size restrictions, rather behavior and efficiency of reactor depends on how it is built and how various parts interact with each other.
book.rbmk.title2=Heat
book.rbmk.page2=As reactor runs, it will generate §lheat§r. Heat will spread between parts, slowly decreasing in the process. The goal is to generate as much heat as possible without melting the reactor, and to transfer heat into steam passages that cool reactor and produce steam.
book.rbmk.title3=Fuel Rod
book.rbmk.page3=The §lfuel rod§r will capture neutron flux, causing fuel inside the rod to react, releasing neutrons in the process. Neutrons are released in all four main directions with a maximum range of 5 blocks. The amount of released neutrons depends on fuel used.
book.rbmk.title4=Regulating Rod
book.rbmk.page4=The §lcontrol rod§r will reduce number of neutrons passing through. Fully inserted, it will block all neutrons; when inserted halfway, it will only block half. Control rods are used to regulate activity of the reactor and shut it down.
book.rbmk.title5=Regulating Rods - Usage
book.rbmk.title5.scale=0.9
book.rbmk.page5=The current bar insertion will be displayed in the center of GUI. The colored buttons on left will add the control bar to the color group, which is useful for quickly selecting grouped bars on §lRBMK§r console. The buttons on right allow you to manually insert in 25%% increments.
book.rbmk.title6=Automatic Control Rods
book.rbmk.page6=§LAutomatic control rods§r are almost identical to regular control rods, but they cannot be manually adjusted, instead they will adjust position of the rod based on current temperature. Which function to use and how deep to insert and at what temperature must be determined first.
book.rbmk.title7=Steam Channel
book.rbmk.page7=The §lsteam channel§r is only part that will actively reduce reactor heat level. If a component is above the boiling point of a given type of steam, it will try to consume as much water and produce as much steam as needed to cool below boiling point.
book.rbmk.title8=Neutron Reflector
book.rbmk.page8=The §lneutron reflector§r will block passage of neutrons, instead neutrons will be reflected back onto the fuel rod they came from. This is useful for using neutrons that would otherwise be wasted simply by leaving reactor.
book.rbmk.title9=Neutron Absorber
book.rbmk.page9=§lNeutron absorber§r simply blocks neutrons. The absorbed neutrons will not generate heat and will be effectively destroyed. This is useful for preventing fuel rods from reacting that would otherwise be within reach.
book.rbmk.title10=Graphite Retarder
book.rbmk.page10=§lGraphite moderator§r converts fast neutrons passing through it into slow neutrons. Most fuels are split into fast neutrons, while slow neutrons are required for fission, so use of moderators is highly recommended.
book.rbmk.title11=Structural Column
book.rbmk.page11=§lStructural column§r does not affect neutrons in any way and has no special application. It is recommended to fill the reactor with structured pillars where there are no other parts, since the structured pillars are capable of transferring heat.
book.rbmk.title12=Console
book.rbmk.page12=§lRBMK console§r allows you to control the reactor from afar. Using the §ldevice to connect the console RBMK§r on the RBMK part and then on the console will connect the reactor and the console. The console can only control 15x15 parts, for large reactors you can use multiple consoles.
book.rbmk.title13=Using the console
book.rbmk.page13=Clicking on parts will select and deselect them. With the colored buttons, you can quickly select all the control rods in that color group. Button "A" will select all control rods, "X" will deselect all.
book.rbmk.page14=Entering a number between 0 and 100 in green box and then pressing button next to it will set all selected control rods to that position. Button "AZ-5" will lead to full insertion of all control rods.
book.rbmk.title15=Fuel
book.rbmk.page15=The §lfuel§r response depends on many factors. The main ones are §lfortification§r, §lxenon poisoning§r and number of incoming §lneutrons§r. Xenon builds up when fuel is low in neutrons and burns out during normal operation. The efficiency of neutrons depends on the type, most fuels §lare best split by§r §lslow neutrons§r.

book.starter.cover=An Industrialist's$Guide to Rebuilding$Society
book.starter.title1=Introduction
book.starter.page1=If you're reading this, it's highly likely that society, in one way or another, has collapsed entirely. Governments, countries, and authority are a concept of the past - along with all of the amenities of civilized life. As such, this guide will inform you how to change that by recreating the industry and technology of the past for the improvement of your own life.
book.starter.title2=Coal & Mustard Gas
book.starter.page2=Whilst it is impossible to predict the actual state of the world in a post-apocalyptic time, it's not unlikely that war and industry in its current form may not have ended. To protect your own lungs, an effective and cheap way is to urinate on some §lcloth§r to make a §ltrench mask§r, to protect you from coal dust or mustard gas, if you ever encounter either.
book.starter.title3=Anvils & Presses
book.starter.page3=The quintessentials to beginning your industrial revitalization is an §lanvil§r and a §lburner press§r. The anvil will allow you to manually craft together early machinery such as the Assembler, whilst the burner press will let you make plates, wires, and circuits that you cannot hammer together with an anvil.
book.starter.title4=Templates
book.starter.page4=In order to stamp metal into useful shapes, assemble machinery, and perform chemical reactions, you will need to create a §lMachine Template Folder§r to create the various stamps and templates shown to the right.
book.starter.title5=Scavenging
book.starter.page5=Depending on how bad the initial apocalyptic event was to the preexisting structures of the world, there's a likely chance that many useful materials and machines can be salvaged from them directly. Metallic alloys like steel, parts like circuitry, and even fissile material from a nuclear power plant might be awaiting you. Beware certain ruins, however, as there may be an excess of danger lurking there like a snake in the grass; waiting to strike you down with radiation, traps, or indescribable horrors...
book.starter.title6=Early Machinery
book.starter.page6a=Two of the first machines you should assemble are the §lBlast Furnace§r and the §lAssembly Machine§r. The former will allow you to create alloys such as §lsteel§r, §lminecraft-grade copper§r, and §ladvanced alloy§r; you will need to use these metals for the bodies of machines, the wiring of circuits, advanced electromagnets, and more.
book.starter.page6b=The assembler will be used to create practically every other machine described in this guide. You will need a power source, such as a §lCombustion§r §lGenerator§r or §lSolar Boiler§r.
book.starter.page7a=The §lShredder§r, along with a pair of shredder blades, will be very useful for doubling the output of most ores, via shredding into smeltable powders. These powders are also crucial to begin making circuitry for various machines, such as §lEnhanced§r and §lOverclocked§r circuits.
book.starter.page7b=Using your new machinery, you can create the §lChemical Plant§r, used for the synthesis of better circuits, concrete, the processing of petrochemicals, and more.
book.starter.title8=Black Gold
book.starter.page8a=Using an §lOil §lReservoir§r §lDetector§r, you can find underground oil deposits to place a §lPumpjack§r or §lDerrick§r over via surveying an area. Remember that oil deposits will run out over time.
book.starter.page8b=Before the oil can be refined and separated into its constituent parts in an §lOil Refinery§r, you must heat the oil to 300°C in a §lBoiler§r.
book.starter.title9=Petrochemicals
book.starter.page9=Using §lChemical Plants§r, §lFractioning§r §lTowers§r, and §lCatalytic Cracking§r §lTowers§r, you can transform the separated oil into a variety of useful products. For example: §lPolymer§r or §lBakelite§r, durable and flexible plastics; §lDesh§r, an extremely durable and heat-resistant rare earth metal alloy; §lSolid Fuel§r, which can be burnt for energy; or even §lLiquid Fuels§r, such as §lGasoline§r, §lDiesel§r, §lKerosene§r, and more.
book.starter.title10=Advanced Machinery
book.starter.page10=With oil processing under your belt, you can create the §lCentrifuge§r, which will triple ore outputs; the §lOre §lAcidizer§r, which will crystallize ores, increasing the yield; and the §lSILEX + §lFEL§r, two marvels of modern engineering which can separate the isotopes of materials with ease. You will require significantly more energy to power these; which can be obtained with sources such as a §lDiesel Generator§r, an §lIndustrial Generator§r, or even a nuclear reactor.
book.starter.title11=Strata
book.starter.page11=Underneath the ground you walk, there is several naturally-occurring §lStrata§r, or special mineral layers and formations. §lSchist Strata§r are blue, lithium-containing layers filled with uranium, iron, copper, asbestos, and other ores for your own use. §lDepth Rock§r contains large quantities of rarer minerals, such as §lZirconium§r and §lBoron§r, but requires explosives to properly harvest.
book.starter.title12=Radiation
book.starter.page12a=§oThe rest of this book will deal with matters that involve §oradiation. For the safety of you and others, I will give §oadvice on how to mitigate and deal with exposure to it.
book.starter.page12b=Enough exposure to radiation can and will cause bodily harm. The first step is prevention; be sure to limit your exposure, and wear protective gear, such as a §lHazmat Suit§r, or apply §lCladding§r to your clothing or armor; you can also take §lRad-X§r to limit your intake. Thanks to modern medicine, the second step can be removal if necessary; for example, a §lPlayer §lDecontaminator§r will slowly reduce the radiation absorbed by your body. §lRad-Away§r can also be used as a post-exposure prophylaxis, quickly and effectively reversing damage caused to your body by ionizing radiation.
book.starter.title13=Uranium Enrichment
book.starter.page13=There are a few, easy options for fuels to use for a nuclear reactor; for instance, §lNatural Uranium§r or §lThorium Fuel§r. However, if you're looking for something more powerful, you can set up an enrichment cascade of two §lGas Centrifuges§r to produce §lUranium Fuel§r with leftover §lUranium-238§r. You will have to transmute the natural uranium into §lYellowcake§r, then §lUranium §lHexafluoride§r to do so.
book.starter.title14=The Chicago Pile
book.starter.page14=Alternatively, you can breed §lReactor-Grade Plutonium§r, a more powerful fuel, from Natural Uranium using the §lChicago Pile§r. By stacking graphite blocks and drilling into them, you can insert fuel rods to breed into plutonium and neutron source rods, such as §lRadium-Beryllium§r, to begin the reaction. Make sure to test your designs; spacing out or limiting the amount of blocks may be necessary to prevent overheating.
book.starter.title15=ZIRNOX GCR
book.starter.page15=Finally, you can create your first §oreal§r source of energy: the §lZIRNOX§r Nuclear Reactor. Nuclear reactors require more setup then other power sources; first, you will want to have a good source of water, such as the §lHeavy §lInfinite Water Tank§r. To remove heat from the reactor core and boil the water into steam, you will need a sufficient amount of §lCarbon Dioxide§r. You want just enough pressure, but not §otoo§r much. You will also need three steam turbines to utilize the created steam to make energy; the §lSteam §lTurbine§r or §lIndustrial Steam §lTurbine§r will be optimal. Finally, a §lCondensor§r or §lAuxilary Cooling Tower§r is needed to condense the leftover steam into water, where it can be voided or recycled in a cooling loop.
book.starter.title16=Conclusion
book.starter.page16=If you've reached this far, you're on track to helping rebuild civilization. You've successfully recreated the advanced machinery of the pre-apocalypse - with nuclear power, petrochemicals, and more. I cannot know §ohow§r you will use these new-found advantages, but it's my personal hope you use them for the good of yourself and others - or at the very least, in self-defense. Au revoir!
book.starter.title18=About the Author
book.starter.page18=vær is just a guy who has been trapped in the grey void featured in the Talking Head's §oOnce In A Lifetime§r for too long. He once found a studio door, but to his dismay found out it was a cardboard cut-out.

#book.rbmk.title9=Neutron Absorber
#book.rbmk.page9=The §lneutron absorber§r will simply block neutrons. Neutrons absorbed will not generate heat and be effectively voided. This is useful to prevent fuel rods from reacting that would otherwise be in range.
#book.rbmk.title10=Graphite Moderator
#book.rbmk.page10=The §lgraphite moderator§r will convert fast neutrons passing through it into slow neutrons. Most fuels fission into fast neutrons while needing slow neutrons to split, so using moderators is strongly recommended.
#book.rbmk.title11=Structural Column
#book.rbmk.page11=The §lstructural column§r will not interfere with neutrons, nor does it have special uses. It is recommended to fill the reactor with structural columns where no other parts will be, because structural columns are capable of transporting heat.
#book.rbmk.title12=Console
#book.rbmk.page12=The §lRBMK console§r lets you control the reactor from afar. Using the §lRBMK§r §lconsole linking device§r on an RBMK part and then the console will link the reactor to the console. The console can only manage 15x15 parts, for larger reactors you might want to use multiple consoles.
#book.rbmk.title13=Console Usage
#book.rbmk.page13=Clicking on the parts will select and deselect them. Using the colored buttons, you can quickly select all control rods of that color group. Button 'A' will select all control rods, 'X' will deselect all.
#book.rbmk.page14=Entering a number 0-100 in the green box and then hitting the button next to it will set all selected control rods to this position. Button 'AZ-5' will cause all control rods to fully insert.
#book.rbmk.title15=Fuel
#book.rbmk.page15=The §lfuel§r's reactivity is based on multiple factors. The main ones are the §lenrichment§r, §lxenon poison§r and the amount of incoming §lneutrons§r. Xenon builds up when the fuel receives few neutrons and burns away during normal operation. The effectivity of neutrons depends on the type, most fuels §lsplit best with slow neutrons§r.

book_lore.book_iodine.page.0=alright you will not believe this, but old man weathervane finally managed to show up again since he left two weeks ago and what's more surprising is the fact that he actually decided to spill the beans on what they were doing in the canyon:
book_lore.book_iodine.page.1=apparently the morons from R&D discovered a compound that is mostly inorganic, pretty much like a toxin in nature, but get this: the dying cells will reproduce said toxin and excrete it through the skin, creating an aerosol that is highly contagious.
book_lore.book_iodine.page.2=it's just like a virus, but not a virus. the composition is weird, you can mix it in any household bottle but you do have to get the order right. the doc told me that the first ingredient which is just powdered iodine crystals goes into slot %d

book_lore.memo_schrab_gsa.page.0=Contract Management - $ $ Legal has made a breakthrough with the DLA. They've awarded us with a 45 BILLION GSA Schedule for further procurement and research of saralloy. At current estimates, that would be at minimum
book_lore.memo_schrab_gsa.page.1=a 40%% profit on related operations, let alone the possibility of future contracts. Due to the confidential nature, all fiscal evidence is to remain private.

book_lore.memo_schrab_rd.name=Internal Memorandum
book_lore.memo_schrab_rd.page.0=Research & Development - $ $ Our main production method of saralloy has been through the new particle accelerator. However, the energy costs are exorbitantly high compared to the amount of output.
book_lore.memo_schrab_rd.page.1=Doctor Schrabauer, however, has discovered a new interaction - called "Strange Lepton Oscillation" - that could significantly reduce costs. Through a not entirely understood process, supplied electrons are transmuted into extremely
book_lore.memo_schrab_rd.page.2=high-energy photons, through a strange charm. This is an extreme exception to many established particle conversion laws, but preliminary experiments have proved that these protons transmute into up and down quarks, eventually creating saralloy.

book_lore.memo_schrab_nuke.page.1=Only our cyclotron has actually created saralloy previously. However, at our underground shot at Everwerpen, miniscule traces of saralloy were found in uranium ore at the site. All pure, metallic uranium nearby had fissioned.
book_lore.memo_schrab_nuke.page.2=As such, given enough uranium ore concentrated around an explosive, or perhaps even a dirty bomb rich in waste containing fissionable material, one could hypothetically create enough saralloy to collect manually.

book_lore.bf_bomb_1.page.1=Of course that was the case. The alumni had their doubts (surprising, considering how bright-eyed they were), but my only... competent? colleague actually got his hands on the primer hand-out. Must have more connections than I thought. His memo is discouraging:
book_lore.bf_bomb_1.page.2=apparently, there's yet ANOTHER miracle material that they prodded out of some concoction of antimatter and a fringe isotope. The brochure calls it "SWIRLMAT" - hell if I know - and that's it. No wonder they wanted a theoretical physicist,

book_lore.bf_bomb_2.author=M. Porter
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.0=Despite the absence of information in that primer, I still had some hope they knew a bit more. Not at all. Every other senior researcher has a blind faith in this material; their propositions were practically biblical. I was near speechless.
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.1=And yet I can't even blame them. Swirlmat makes no goddamn sense - it is completely unlike any other substance I've seen before. Its appearance was near frightening, a literal mass of swirling colors, with darker lines permeating through the neon green surface.
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.2=Even worse, this thing is an energy source. The existence of our sample is a violation of ALARA: the lab was vacated when it arrived, and the only person brave enough (one Dr. Melfyn) donned a level A hazmat just to carry it 20 meters.
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.3=The empirical data isn't better, as we're breaking the first law of thermodynamics with how much energy it radiates. Being anywhere near that thing - even behind a meter of lead - was terrifying. We sprinted out of the chamber upon conclusion of the spectroscopy
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.4=and we got nothing new out of it. Those idiots in the science team, god, did not even waver after all that. Sitting through those "discussions" was horrible; that quack of a head researcher even rumored that the test ban would be lifted, that we could be
book_lore.bf_bomb_2.page.5=building bombs out of the shit in the coming weeks, who in their right mind would work on that? Hell, the one sane assistant (an Andrew) nicknamed it "balefire" - because burning to death on a funeral pyre would be painless by comparison.

book_lore.bf_bomb_3.author=M. Porter
book_lore.bf_bomb_3.page.0=The team and I have made some breakthroughs. Emphasis on the separation - isolating myself from the more devout has made working there so much more bearable. While we still have no idea about the actual properties of balefire (it's difficult to analyze
book_lore.bf_bomb_3.page.1=a sample that fries your equipment) its interactions with other matter has proved fruitful. Notably, they synthesized a "gaseous" form: Andrew, of all people, informed me that it was really a colloid consisting of microscopic balefire particles, suspended in some
book_lore.bf_bomb_3.page.2=noble gas. Each particle is enveloped by a positively-charged 'bubble' of ionized gas, preventing it from settling. Who could've guessed that fatal gamma radiation had a benefit? Not me. $ I'm choosing not to think about how they transformed the sample into
book_lore.bf_bomb_3.page.3=particulate, but I can't understate the utility of this gaseous balefire - it's made it much safer to experiment on. $ Speaking of safety, the head researcher (in an act of callous disregard) made a discovery that also nearly took his head off.
book_lore.bf_bomb_3.page.4=He decided to get "dirty" by letting a cell of our new colloid interact directly with some very expensive antimatter: the resulting explosion turned the table it was on into a piece of radiation-bleached slag, carved a near-perfect hemisphere through

book_lore.bf_bomb_4.page.1=Well, the dipshit in charge of our lab got something right for once. The denunciation came with a flurry of new "scientists" joining, just so we could weaponize balefire. The lack of critical thought here is honestly baffling - bless him, Andrew even jumped ship the
book_lore.bf_bomb_4.page.2=second the first fucking BOMB DESIGN was drafted. That ass Melfyn looked so happy with his little mechanism - perhaps he got brainworms from carrying that sample? - which involved some stupid shit using the solidified, base balefire and an HV
book_lore.bf_bomb_4.page.3=battery. $ Apparently, the form matters for energy output and activation method or whatever, kind of like uranium versus plutonium in regular nukes, but the end result is an initial shock starting the explosion. I find it funny, hilarious even.
book_lore.bf_bomb_4.page.4=All of them place such emphasis on the activation; they ignore the actual mechanism of it all because they don't have a single clue how it works! It may as well be magic at this point, and yet they're still trying to twist and bend it - just for more weapons of war.

book_lore.beacon.author=Flim Flam Industries
book_lore.beacon.page.0=Thank you for your purchase of a Mk.2 Illuminated Signal Beacon (rev. 1.3)! This small booklet will provide a short introduction in the operation of the beacon, as well as its inner workings.
book_lore.beacon.page.1=Chapter 1: Architecture $ Each unit is composed of four main parts: The control circuit, a lantern, a fog horn and the casing which houses the other parts. For a detailed explanation of the main circuit, please
book_lore.beacon.page.2=refer to the circuit diagram found on the inside of the maintenance lid of the casing. The lantern is made up of a polycarbonate case containing a dual-color 250 Watt halogen bulb with a standard 200mm socket, replacements
book_lore.beacon.page.3=for the bulb can be ordered from our stores. Third party bulbs are not recommended, as we cannot ensure safe operation. The case is made from a specialized zinc-coated stainless steel and is resistant to weathering.
book_lore.beacon.page.4=Chapter 2: Lantern $ The lantern's primary uses are providing light for ease of maintenance in harsh weather conditions as well as a status indicator. Should the power-on self test (POST) fail, the lantern will
book_lore.beacon.page.5=light up red, otherwise it will light up green. Note that colors can vary depending on the replacement bulb.
book_lore.beacon.page.6=Chapter 3: Fog Horn $ The fog horn is the primary communication device of the beacon. The beacon is designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) communication as well as for message broadcasting.
book_lore.beacon.page.7=Chapter 4: Peer-to-Peer $ For details on communication, refer to the communications handbook. A short rundown of establishing a P2P connection follows: First, the beacon has to give the "START CONNECTION" signal,
book_lore.beacon.page.8=being a single long tone. All available peers should respond with a single long tone as well (order specified by proximity, as well as the communication guidelines outlined in the handbook, section "Responding to a Connection")
book_lore.beacon.page.9=Once the desired peer has responded, give the "ACCEPT CONNECTION" signal, being two long tones, the peer will then also respond with two long tones. All communication afterwards has to happen using pre-negotiated signals, most commonly
book_lore.beacon.page.10=using the FAR-5M standard. Communication will end immediately if no standard has been negotiated, serving as a "ping". Should communication continue, the connection can be ended using another long single tone "END CONNECTION".

cannery.centrifuge=Gas Centrifuge
cannery.centrifuge.0=Gas centrifuges can be supplied with fluid using regular fluid ducts.
cannery.centrifuge.1=Most recipes require multiple centrifuges. The intermediate products cannot be transported via pipes.
cannery.centrifuge.2=This side acts as a connector which outputs the intermediate product into an adjacent centrifuge.
cannery.centrifuge.3=Uranium hexafluoride can be processed with just two centrifuges, this however will produce Uranium fuel and Uranium-238.
cannery.centrifuge.4=Fully processing it into Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 requires a total of four centrifuges.
cannery.centrifuge.5=Some recipes also require the centrifuge overclocking upgrade.

cannery.crucible=Crucible
cannery.crucible.0=The crucible is used to smelt ores, ingots or other metallic items for alloying and to cast them into different shapes.
cannery.crucible.1=It requires an external heat source connected to the bottom, like a firebox.
cannery.crucible.2=Once heated up, the crucible can be used in two ways, with or without a recipe template.
cannery.crucible.3=The crucible has two storage buffers for material:
cannery.crucible.4=The buffer to the left is for §abyproducts§r, all material smelted without a recipe template will land here.
cannery.crucible.5=If a recipe is installed, materials that do not match the recipe will also be stored here.
cannery.crucible.6=Materials in this buffer will not react with each other, they can only be output from the green outlet for casting.
cannery.crucible.7=The buffer to the right is for §crecipes§r, if a recipe is installed and that particular material is relevant to that recipe, it will land here.
cannery.crucible.8=The materials will slowly combine into the output material which is automatically output from the red outlet.
cannery.crucible.9=Note that only this buffer handles recipes. If a template is installed retroactively, materials in the byproduct buffer will not combine, nor transfer to the recipe buffer.
cannery.crucible.10=The outlet will output material automatically, if the target is valid, for example a foundry channel or a mold.
cannery.crucible.11=As with all foundry blocks, a shovel can be used to remove all material from the crucible.

cannery.fensu=FEnSU
cannery.fensu.0=The FEnSU is capable of storing absurd amounts of energy, over 9EHE (that's a nine followed by 18 zeros).
cannery.fensu.1=There is only one energy connector which can be found on the bottom.
cannery.fensu.2=This is also the only place where the FEnSU can receive a redstone signal.

cannery.firebox=Firebox
cannery.firebox.0=The firebox burns flammable items to generate heat.
cannery.firebox.1=It can burn any flammable item, although higher quality fuels such as coal, coke and solid fuel burn longer and hotter.
cannery.firebox.2=Heat is given off by the copper contact at the top of the firebox. Machines with an identical contact on the bottom can receive heat by being placed on top of the firebox.
cannery.firebox.3=If heat isn't being used up and the heat buffer becomes full, the firebox will shut off to prevent wasting of fuel.
cannery.firebox.4=One such machine is the stirling engine, which will turn heat directly into energy.

cannery.foundryChannel=Foundry Channel
cannery.foundryChannel.0=Foundry channels are used to transport molten material from a crucible or storage tank into molds.
cannery.foundryChannel.1=Channels can receive material either by pouring from the top - via an outlet or directly from a crucible - or from the side from other channels.
cannery.foundryChannel.2=When transporting materials, channels will prioritize blocks like outlets and shallow molds.
cannery.foundryChannel.3=When it cannot supply an outlet or a mold, the material will then flow into a neighboring channel.
cannery.foundryChannel.4=Leftover material can be removed by using a shovel.

cannery.silex=FEL & SILEX
cannery.silex.0=The Free Electron Laser (FEL) uses energy and a laser crystal to create a powerful laser beam.
cannery.silex.1=Be careful, as the laser will burn/melt through weaker blocks...
cannery.silex.2=...but not blast-proof ones.
cannery.silex.3=The FEL is used to power the Laser Isotope Separation Chamber (SILEX). The FEL and SILEX have to be at least two blocks apart.
cannery.silex.4=The laser has to enter through the glass openings of the SILEX. Aiming it wrong could destroy it.
cannery.silex.5=The openings on the sides can be used to connect fluid ducts to the SILEX.
cannery.silex.6=In addition to the two connectors on the sides, there is a third hidden connector at the bottom from which items can be extracted.
cannery.silex.7=Each recipe requires a specific laser type. Using a stronger type than required will process items faster.
cannery.silex.8=One FEL can supply up to 5 SILEX. Each SILEX has to be one block apart from one another.

cannery.stirling=Stirling Engine
cannery.stirling.0=The Stirling engine uses heat energy from external sources to create power.
cannery.stirling.1=It needs to be placed on top of a heat-producing machine, such as the firebox.
cannery.stirling.2=The amount of heat it can utilize however is limited, overspinning can lead to catastrophic malfunction.
cannery.stirling.3=The upgraded version can take significantly more heat without breaking.

cannery.willow=Mustard Willow
cannery.willow.0=The mustard willow is a plant that allows cadmium metal to be harvested.
cannery.willow.1=Willows can be placed on dirt, grass or even dead/oily dirt, but they require water to grow.
cannery.willow.2=Willows can be fertilized with bone meal or industrial fertilizer. They do not need light to grow.
cannery.willow.3=After the second stage of growth, they will need an extra block of space above them to grow further.
cannery.willow.4=After the fourth stage of growth, they require dead or oily dirt below them.
cannery.willow.5=This can be done either by manually planting willows on dead/oily dirt, or by having a hydraulic fracking tower nearby which continuously contaminates the ground.
cannery.willow.6=After reaching the final stage, the willow will remove contamination from the ground, reverting the dead/oily dirt back into regular dirt.
cannery.willow.7=Now the willow's leaves can be harvested. Breaking the top block will drop a small willow plant, 3-6 leaves and keep the bottom part of the plant intact.
cannery.willow.8=Soon the plant will start growing again, yielding more leaves if the dirt is replaced with oily dirt. The leaves can be processed into cadmium powder using an ore acidizer.
cannery.willow.9=Harvesting willow leaves can be automated using the automatic buzzsaw, it will only break plants that are ready for harvest.

cannery.hadron=Particle Accelerator
cannery.hadron.0=A Particle Accelerator consists of three main parts: A Core, an Analysis Chamber, and a set of Superconducting Coils
cannery.hadron.1=This is the Particle Accelerator Core Component, which fires particles at relativistic speeds down the coils towards the Analysis Chamber
cannery.hadron.2=Particles are ejected from here
cannery.hadron.3=And in circular accelerators, return to here
cannery.hadron.4=A coil segment is constructed by using 8 Dense Coils with nothing (or the core) in the middle
cannery.hadron.5=This coil segment must itself also be enclosed within Particle Accelerator Plating
cannery.hadron.6=To access the Core Component, you'll need to add one or more Access Terminals
cannery.hadron.7=The Core Component will also require power to operate, add a power plug on an edge
cannery.hadron.8=The Accelerator will require enough Power Plugs to supply at least 10KHE of electricity per unit of Coil Strength
cannery.hadron.9=Note that the coil segment that wraps around the Core Component is not factored into the Coil Strength calculation
cannery.hadron.10=Nor is this coil segment required for purely linear accelerators
cannery.hadron.11=For circular accelerators, you will need to add corners to change the direction of the particle
cannery.hadron.12=The outside corner coils can be omitted entirely
cannery.hadron.13=The final part of our Accelerator is the Analysis Chamber, which is a 3x3x3 empty chamber surrounded by Analysis Chamber blocks
cannery.hadron.14=Your completed Particle Accelerator should look something like this!

cannery.hadron.math.0=Neodymium Coil Strength: 50
cannery.hadron.math.1=50 x 8 x 10KHE = 400 x 10KHE = 4MHE
cannery.hadron.math.2=Starmetal Coil Strength: 1,000
cannery.hadron.math.3=1,000 x 8 x 10KHE = 8,000 x 10KHE = 80MHE

cannery.schottky=Schottky Particle Diode
cannery.schottky.0=This is a Schottky Particle Diode. It can allow for more complex particle accelerator designs and save on electricity
cannery.schottky.1=By default it blocks all particles and must be configured with a Screwdriver
cannery.schottky.2=This face will now accept entering particles
cannery.schottky.3=And this face will eject particles that enter
cannery.schottky.4=The diode now has two exits, and will now behave in a quantum manner, creating virtual particles for each exit
cannery.schottky.5=Once all the virtual particles have reached an Analysis Chamber, the particle with the lowest momentum required for the current recipe is chosen
cannery.schottky.6=The chosen particle undergoes a wavefunction collapse and is made real, consuming only the power that the collapsing particle requires
cannery.schottky.7=If any virtual particles encounter any malformed segments, all virtual particles will be discarded and the erroring particle will be collapsed instead
cannery.schottky.8=Note that virtual particles will never use the same Diode exit twice. Infinite loops will fail, but re-entering a Diode is otherwise fine
cannery.schottky.9=Your Schottky Particle Diode should be properly enclosed, with free paths for each intersection exit

She asks for a$dish without Spam, much to the amazement of her Spam-loving husband. The waitress$responds to this request with disgust. Mr. Bun offers to take her Spam instead,$and asks for a dish containing a lot of Spam and baked beans. The waitress says$no since they are out of baked beans; when Mr. Bun asks for a substitution of Spam,$the waitress again responds with disgust. At several points, a group of Vikings in$the restaurant interrupts conversation by loudly singing about Spam.$The irate waitress orders them to shut up, but they resume singing more loudly.$A Hungarian tourist comes to the counter, trying to order by using a wholly$inaccurate Hungarian/English phrasebook (a reference to a previous sketch).$He is rapidly escorted away by a police constable. The sketch abruptly cuts to a$historian in a television studio talking about the origin of the Vikings in the café.$As he goes on, he begins to increasingly insert the word "Spam" into every$sentence, and the backdrop is raised to reveal the restaurant set behind.$The historian joins the Vikings in their song, and Mr. and Mrs. Bun are lifted by$wires out of the scene while the singing continues. In the original televised performance,$the closing credits begin to scroll with the singing still audible in the background.
