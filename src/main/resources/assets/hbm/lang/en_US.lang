book.rbmk.cover=My first RBMK:$Basics of$building a$reactor
book.rbmk.title1=Introduction
book.rbmk.page1=§lRBMK§r is fully modular nuclear reactor. Unlike most other reactors, there is no "core" and no size restrictions, rather behavior and efficiency of reactor depends on how it is built and how various parts interact with each other.
book.rbmk.title2=Heat
book.rbmk.page2=As reactor runs, it will generate §lheat§r. Heat will spread between parts, slowly decreasing in the process. The goal is to generate as much heat as possible without melting the reactor, and to transfer heat into steam passages that cool reactor and produce steam.
book.rbmk.title3=Fuel Rod
book.rbmk.page3=The §lfuel rod§r will capture neutron flux, causing fuel inside the rod to react, releasing neutrons in the process. Neutrons are released in all four main directions with a maximum range of 5 blocks. The amount of released neutrons depends on fuel used.
book.rbmk.title4=Regulating Rod
book.rbmk.page4=The §lcontrol rod§r will reduce number of neutrons passing through. Fully inserted, it will block all neutrons; when inserted halfway, it will only block half. Control rods are used to regulate activity of the reactor and shut it down.
book.rbmk.title5=Regulating Rods - Usage
book.rbmk.title5.scale=0.9
book.rbmk.page5=The current bar insertion will be displayed in the center of GUI. The colored buttons on left will add the control bar to the color group, which is useful for quickly selecting grouped bars on §lRBMK§r console. The buttons on right allow you to manually insert in 25%% increments.
book.rbmk.title6=Automatic Control Rods
book.rbmk.page6=§LAutomatic control rods§r are almost identical to regular control rods, but they cannot be manually adjusted, instead they will adjust position of the rod based on current temperature. Which function to use and how deep to insert and at what temperature must be determined first.
book.rbmk.title7=Steam Channel
book.rbmk.page7=The §lsteam channel§r is only part that will actively reduce reactor heat level. If a component is above the boiling point of a given type of steam, it will try to consume as much water and produce as much steam as needed to cool below boiling point.
book.rbmk.title8=Neutron Reflector
book.rbmk.page8=The §lneutron reflector§r will block passage of neutrons, instead neutrons will be reflected back onto the fuel rod they came from. This is useful for using neutrons that would otherwise be wasted simply by leaving reactor.
book.rbmk.title9=Neutron Absorber
book.rbmk.page9=§lNeutron absorber§r simply blocks neutrons. The absorbed neutrons will not generate heat and will be effectively destroyed. This is useful for preventing fuel rods from reacting that would otherwise be within reach.
book.rbmk.title10=Graphite Retarder
book.rbmk.page10=§lGraphite moderator§r converts fast neutrons passing through it into slow neutrons. Most fuels are split into fast neutrons, while slow neutrons are required for fission, so use of moderators is highly recommended.
book.rbmk.title11=Structural Column
book.rbmk.page11=§lStructural column§r does not affect neutrons in any way and has no special application. It is recommended to fill the reactor with structured pillars where there are no other parts, since the structured pillars are capable of transferring heat.
book.rbmk.title12=Console
book.rbmk.page12=§lRBMK console§r allows you to control the reactor from afar. Using the §ldevice to connect the console RBMK§r on the RBMK part and then on the console will connect the reactor and the console. The console can only control 15x15 parts, for large reactors you can use multiple consoles.
book.rbmk.title13=Using the console
book.rbmk.page13=Clicking on parts will select and deselect them. With the colored buttons, you can quickly select all the control rods in that color group. Button "A" will select all control rods, "X" will deselect all.
book.rbmk.page14=Entering a number between 0 and 100 in green box and then pressing button next to it will set all selected control rods to that position. Button "AZ-5" will lead to full insertion of all control rods.
book.rbmk.title15=Fuel
book.rbmk.page15=The §lfuel§r response depends on many factors. The main ones are §lfortification§r, §lxenon poisoning§r and number of incoming §lneutrons§r. Xenon builds up when fuel is low in neutrons and burns out during normal operation. The efficiency of neutrons depends on the type, most fuels §lare best split by§r §lslow neutrons§r.

book.starter.cover=An Industrialist's$Guide to Rebuilding$Society
book.starter.title1=Introduction
book.starter.page1=If you're reading this, it's highly likely that society, in one way or another, has collapsed entirely. Governments, countries, and authority are a concept of the past - along with all of the amenities of civilized life. As such, this guide will inform you how to change that by recreating the industry and technology of the past for the improvement of your own life.
book.starter.title2=Coal & Mustard Gas
book.starter.page2=Whilst it is impossible to predict the actual state of the world in a post-apocalyptic time, it's not unlikely that war and industry in its current form may not have ended. To protect your own lungs, an effective and cheap way is to urinate on some §lcloth§r to make a §ltrench mask§r, to protect you from coal dust or mustard gas, if you ever encounter either.
book.starter.title3=Anvils & Presses
book.starter.page3=The quintessentials to beginning your industrial revitalization is an §lanvil§r and a §lburner press§r. The anvil will allow you to manually craft together early machinery such as the Assembler, whilst the burner press will let you make plates, wires, and circuits that you cannot hammer together with an anvil.
book.starter.title4=Templates
book.starter.page4=In order to stamp metal into useful shapes, assemble machinery, and perform chemical reactions, you will need to create a §lMachine Template Folder§r to create the various stamps and templates shown to the right.
book.starter.title5=Scavenging
book.starter.page5=Depending on how bad the initial apocalyptic event was to the preexisting structures of the world, there's a likely chance that many useful materials and machines can be salvaged from them directly. Metallic alloys like steel, parts like circuitry, and even fissile material from a nuclear power plant might be awaiting you. Beware certain ruins, however, as there may be an excess of danger lurking there like a snake in the grass; waiting to strike you down with radiation, traps, or indescribable horrors...
book.starter.title6=Early Machinery
book.starter.page6a=Two of the first machines you should assemble are the §lBlast Furnace§r and the §lAssembly Machine§r. The former will allow you to create alloys such as §lsteel§r, §lminecraft-grade copper§r, and §ladvanced alloy§r; you will need to use these metals for the bodies of machines, the wiring of circuits, advanced electromagnets, and more.
book.starter.page6b=The assembler will be used to create practically every other machine described in this guide. You will need a power source, such as a §lCombustion§r §lGenerator§r or §lSolar Boiler§r.
book.starter.page7a=The §lShredder§r, along with a pair of shredder blades, will be very useful for doubling the output of most ores, via shredding into smeltable powders. These powders are also crucial to begin making circuitry for various machines, such as §lEnhanced§r and §lOverclocked§r circuits.
book.starter.page7b=Using your new machinery, you can create the §lChemical Plant§r, used for the synthesis of better circuits, concrete, the processing of petrochemicals, and more.
book.starter.title8=Black Gold
book.starter.page8a=Using an §lOil §lReservoir§r §lDetector§r, you can find underground oil deposits to place a §lPumpjack§r or §lDerrick§r over via surveying an area. Remember that oil deposits will run out over time.
book.starter.page8b=Before the oil can be refined and separated into its constituent parts in an §lOil Refinery§r, you must heat the oil to 300°C in a §lBoiler§r.
book.starter.title9=Petrochemicals
book.starter.page9=Using §lChemical Plants§r, §lFractioning§r §lTowers§r, and §lCatalytic Cracking§r §lTowers§r, you can transform the separated oil into a variety of useful products. For example: §lPolymer§r or §lBakelite§r, durable and flexible plastics; §lDesh§r, an extremely durable and heat-resistant rare earth metal alloy; §lSolid Fuel§r, which can be burnt for energy; or even §lLiquid Fuels§r, such as §lGasoline§r, §lDiesel§r, §lKerosene§r, and more.
book.starter.title10=Advanced Machinery
book.starter.page10=With oil processing under your belt, you can create the §lCentrifuge§r, which will triple ore outputs; the §lOre §lAcidizer§r, which will crystallize ores, increasing the yield; and the §lSILEX + §lFEL§r, two marvels of modern engineering which can separate the isotopes of materials with ease. You will require significantly more energy to power these; which can be obtained with sources such as a §lDiesel Generator§r, an §lIndustrial Generator§r, or even a nuclear reactor.
book.starter.title11=Strata
book.starter.page11=Underneath the ground you walk, there is several naturally-occurring §lStrata§r, or special mineral layers and formations. §lSchist Strata§r are blue, lithium-containing layers filled with uranium, iron, copper, asbestos, and other ores for your own use. §lDepth Rock§r contains large quantities of rarer minerals, such as §lZirconium§r and §lBoron§r, but requires explosives to properly harvest.
book.starter.title12=Radiation
book.starter.page12a=§oThe rest of this book will deal with matters that involve §oradiation. For the safety of you and others, I will give §oadvice on how to mitigate and deal with exposure to it.
book.starter.page12b=Enough exposure to radiation can and will cause bodily harm. The first step is prevention; be sure to limit your exposure, and wear protective gear, such as a §lHazmat Suit§r, or apply §lCladding§r to your clothing or armor; you can also take §lRad-X§r to limit your intake. Thanks to modern medicine, the second step can be removal if necessary; for example, a §lPlayer §lDecontaminator§r will slowly reduce the radiation absorbed by your body. §lRad-Away§r can also be used as a post-exposure prophylaxis, quickly and effectively reversing damage caused to your body by ionizing radiation.
book.starter.title13=Uranium Enrichment
book.starter.page13=There are a few, easy options for fuels to use for a nuclear reactor; for instance, §lNatural Uranium§r or §lThorium Fuel§r. However, if you're looking for something more powerful, you can set up an enrichment cascade of two §lGas Centrifuges§r to produce §lUranium Fuel§r with leftover §lUranium-238§r. You will have to transmute the natural uranium into §lYellowcake§r, then §lUranium §lHexafluoride§r to do so.
book.starter.title14=The Chicago Pile
book.starter.page14=Alternatively, you can breed §lReactor-Grade Plutonium§r, a more powerful fuel, from Natural Uranium using the §lChicago Pile§r. By stacking graphite blocks and drilling into them, you can insert fuel rods to breed into plutonium and neutron source rods, such as §lRadium-Beryllium§r, to begin the reaction. Make sure to test your designs; spacing out or limiting the amount of blocks may be necessary to prevent overheating.
book.starter.title15=ZIRNOX GCR
book.starter.page15=Finally, you can create your first §oreal§r source of energy: the §lZIRNOX§r Nuclear Reactor. Nuclear reactors require more setup then other power sources; first, you will want to have a good source of water, such as the §lHeavy §lInfinite Water Tank§r. To remove heat from the reactor core and boil the water into steam, you will need a sufficient amount of §lCarbon Dioxide§r. You want just enough pressure, but not §otoo§r much. You will also need three steam turbines to utilize the created steam to make energy; the §lSteam §lTurbine§r or §lIndustrial Steam §lTurbine§r will be optimal. Finally, a §lCondensor§r or §lAuxilary Cooling Tower§r is needed to condense the leftover steam into water, where it can be voided or recycled in a cooling loop.
book.starter.title16=Conclusion
book.starter.page16=If you've reached this far, you're on track to helping rebuild civilization. You've successfully recreated the advanced machinery of the pre-apocalypse - with nuclear power, petrochemicals, and more. I cannot know §ohow§r you will use these new-found advantages, but it's my personal hope you use them for the good of yourself and others - or at the very least, in self-defense. Au revoir!
book.starter.title18=About the Author
book.starter.page18=vær is just a guy who has been trapped in the grey void featured in the Talking Head's §oOnce In A Lifetime§r for too long. He once found a studio door, but to his dismay found out it was a cardboard cut-out.
