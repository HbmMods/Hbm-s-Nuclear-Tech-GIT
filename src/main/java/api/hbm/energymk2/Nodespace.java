		 * Okay so here's the deal: The code has shit idiot brain fungus. I don't know why. I re-tested every part involved several times.
		 * I don't know why. But for some reason, during neighbor checks, on certain arbitrary fucking places, the joining operation just fails.
		 * Disallowing nodes to create new networks fixed the problem completely, which is hardly surprising since they wouldn't be able to make
		 * a new net anyway and they will re-check neighbors until a net is found, so the solution is tautological in nature. So I tried limiting
		 * creation of new networks. Didn't work. So what's there left to do? Hand out a mark to any node that has changed networks, and let those
		 * recently modified nodes do another re-check. This creates a second layer of redundant operations, and in theory doubles (in practice,
		 * it might be an extra 20% due to break-off section sizes) the amount of CPU time needed for re-building the networks after joining or
		 * breaking, but it seems to allow those parts to connect back to their neighbor nets as they are supposed to. I am not proud of this solution,
		 * this issue shouldn't exist to begin with and I am going fucking insane but it is what it is.
