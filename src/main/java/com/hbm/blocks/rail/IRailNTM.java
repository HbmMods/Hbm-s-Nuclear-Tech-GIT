	 * Inherently safer than simply adding the motion to the position and then snapping, since that may lead to derailing.
	 * The motion has to be calculated from the train's rotation (rotated 180Â° when going backwards), the scalar doesn't matter since it's only used for determining orientation in a clear way.
	 * Motion ends up being *-1 if the train is going in reverse, still pointing forwards despite the speed being negative.
	 * Also features a double[] wrapper with size 1 which holds the speed value that overshoots the rail.
